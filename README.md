The TokenFactory project provides a simple web interface for creating ERC20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Here are the main steps to use the application:

• Connect your MetaMask wallet to the Ethereum network (Mumbai Testnet)

• Enter the token details such as name, symbol, and total supply in the input fields.

• Click on the "Create Token" button to deploy the ERC20 token contract to the Ethereum network (Mumbai Testnet)

• Confirm the transaction in MetaMask and wait for the transaction to be mined.

• Once the token is created, you can see the token details and the contract address on the screen.

• You can also view the created token in MetaMask or any other Ethereum wallet by pushing button “Add token to MetaMask”.
